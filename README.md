# 👋 Hi, I'm Vyshnav — Technical Writer | Documentation Engineer

Welcome! I'm a **Software Technical Writer** with a strong technical foundation and a passion for delivering clear, useful, and scalable documentation. I thrive at the intersection of **engineering, communication, and user experience** — where great docs don't just explain, they enable.

### 🔧 API & Platform Documentation
- Design and maintain **interactive API documentation** using **Swagger/OpenAPI** and **Postman**
- Collaborate with engineering teams to document **RESTful**, **GraphQL**, and **gRPC** APIs with real-world examples
- Validate and test endpoints via **Postman** tool to ensure documentation accuracy

### 🛠️ Technical Proficiency & Dev Tooling
- Use **Docker** to simulate environments and verify installation/setup guides
- Build automated documentation pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **MkDocs**, and **CI/CD tools**

### 🤝 Agile Collaboration
- Work in **Agile/Scrum environments**, actively participating in sprints, grooming sessions, and retrospectives
- Use **Jira** to manage documentation tickets, story points, and sprint progress
- Contribute to Definition of Done by embedding documentation quality gates into workflows
